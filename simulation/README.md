# Imitation Learning on Udacity Simulator
Repository contains Python scripts to implement imitation learning Udacity simulator.

## Data Acquisition
You can collect data from the simulator in "training mode" by manually driving the vehicle using keyboard. However, I also provide the dataset if you're too lazy to do it yourself.

## Demo

Download the simulator here:
[Simulator (Windows)](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-selfdrivingcar/Term1-Sim/term1-simulator-windows.zip)

Run the simulator in "autonomous mode", then run the *main.py* script. It does not matter where you put the simulator folder, you will be able to run it everywhere.
